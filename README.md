# Agile Board Task Management
## Introduction
This is a simple task management web application that allows users to organise tasks on an agile board with columns for "TODO", "DOING", "DONE" statuses.

## Features
* Task Management: Add, edit, delete, and move tasks between different status columns.
* Responsive Design: The application is designed to work well on desktop mobile devices.
* Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark themes for better user experience.
* Local Storage: Tasks and board settings are saved to the browser's local storage, allowing users to persist their data across sections.

## Files
* index.html
* index.css
* index.js
* assets/


## Reflections
* I learned how to implement dynamic functionality using JavaScript, using as adding event listeners, manipulating the DOM, and interacting with local storage.
* And, also I gained experience in organising project files and directories in a clear and logical manner for better maintainability and collaboration.


Overall, this project was a great learning experience, and I am excited to continue improving my skills and working on more projects in the future.
